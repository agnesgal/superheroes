1,1,"The first Avenger movie ofc! We had Loki, who is a powerful and charismatic villain from a previous movie. But even though someone did not see the first Thor movie would understand and appreciate it. So, yes! The team is building, we know most of them, but the other characters and the story is awesome too. Albeit never forget about the humour, I loved it.",3
1,2,I hate Marvel movies. They are lame and you are lame too. Batman would beat all of them and we still did't talk about our Superman. Grrr!,3
1,3,Haters are always the funniest part of these crap fan pages :DDDD,5
2,4,"Yes, I have watched all the movies, but maybe you should start the Dr. Who series, because you should not watch the parts before you have seen all of them.",0
2,5,You suck...why have you not seen all film???,1
3,6,"In MCU Loki of course, but in the comic world the Living Tribunal.",0
1,7,"Guys, seriously! If you don't like these things why the hell are you here?? I never had any problem with DC or Marvel. Just tired of this kind of people...",2
8,8,"Well, yep. I don't care. I mean there are more importent parts in the new film, just Hiddleston's fans can show up everywhere. Fandom world...meh.",9
8,9,"I don't think so. I saw the Infinity War trailer, so yes, he will give up on the Tesseract, but maybe he just want to rescue his brother and the entire asgardian group. In Ragnarok he had an amazing character development.",8
2,10,"Not yet, but I would like to. Marvel films are very popular nowadays, right?",0
1,11,"Trolls everywhere. By the way, if I can answer to the question and not just continue the fight, then I have an answer. For me as a Scandinavia maniac girl the asgardian world will be always my favorite place. I like these tales and we are very lucky to have superheroes/villains like Thor or Loki.",-3
10,12,"Taika Waititi always had excellent choice to the cast. His humour is fantastic, I love every movie from his filmography. Goldblum's character is just as crazy as the others. Maybe that is the main reason why the Ragnarok is my favorite movie.",3
3,13,"Sexy Cate Blanchett as Hela!! That's obvious, haha",3
3,14,"DC is better at villains, but of course we have Loki, so yes, and Thanos is awesome too. By the way, I like Ebony Maw...he's from the comics and in some games. Not in the movies (maybe yet, who knows?). So to be honest from just like example the Gotham has more kick-ass villain, than Marvel.",0
8,15,"Well, it is hard to say, but I think unintentionally yes. If Thanos not kill him in the first sight, because of the first Avengers's mistakes then yes. Must be.",7
7,16,"The most famour one, yes, of course. For example the Civil War was really epic. Most of the Iron Man and Hulk things are exciting too. Just try something from your favorite charater, you will like it and the previous things are written on the first pages, so go on! For me it is a nice pastime after work.",0
7,17,Spiderman is awesome!!!!,0
3,18,Iron Man!! I don't like his moral acts.,1
8,19,I LOVE TOM HIDDLESTON!,9
9,20,"Cap oviously, but I thing mos of them. After the shocking two part of the Infinity War could come the new generation. I mean, I kinda wait the New Avengers. They are cool too, don't you think? ",0
9,21,"Everybody can die, but let me live Thor for me! He is a fuckin' GOD, so he couldn't die anyway. Haha!!! ",0
8,22,Thanos is enough strong without other villains. That's for cure.,5
10,23,"Yes, absolutely agree. I loved the whole Ragnarok's style. Thor series needed a fresh voice.",2
5,24,"Haha, it's funny to think about how many people are talking about this meaningless detail. I mean he looks awesome and scary. Anyway he must be defeated, so I don't really care which color he has on his face when he will be kicked-out. Right??",0
11,25,Agree.,1
12,26,"Thor is the best. Deep down you know that too, because you're picture is about him. Haha!",3
